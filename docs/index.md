# Loadout.report documentation and friends

Credits for the setup goes to Nev, I just took the github repo :(

### "i just want to play with the API"

excellent. the two major components of the API are:
- [the definitions](/definitions/exploring)
- or the [live data endpoints](/api/spec)

### "i know how to program, and want to make something with the API"

now that's what we like to hear.  
read up on the [technical basics](/api/basics) and then pick an [API operation](/goals) to learn more about.

### "just give me an index of subjects"

okay. [a table of contents just for you](/subjects)
