# the manifest/definitions

## what are the definitions?

some people call it "the manifest". if you're josh, it's "the definitions".  
technically "the manifest" is what you check, to learn where to download "the definitions"
  
the definitions contain the words, titles, names, images, etc. which help translate raw data like

> `"itemHash":1022552290,"quantity":69420`

into friendlier shapes like

> "the user has 69420 ![](https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/b3e829460a53354a92d8f893c44db3b7.png) Legendary Shards"

## what aren't they?

- they are static data, updated every few weeks or months. they aren't anyone's current **inventory**
- they don't have **enemy units** (dreg/acolyte/etc)
- they don't have **sandbox** and **gameplay** numbers/stats
  - no **range** in meters. no **damage numbers**. the impact & range stats are abstractions
  - they don't have accurate **magazine stats**. these are adjusted by gameplay scripts, and though many seem right/almost, others just aren't
  - no **XP** values
